    "Most exams in Kenyan secondary to higher learning institutions are hand-written, they are then assessed by the lectures/teacher who then, individually decide the score for each answer and collectively for each paper. The process is long and strenuous, taking a lot of energy and time for the educators. For the students, the time taken for assessment reduces the quality and quantity of attention they get from their lecturers/teachers; the results too, considering the human element, might also be biased and inaccuracte. For institutions, learning calendars and the quality of learning experiences are negatively affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be improved through artificial intelligence, specifically by incoporating machine learning models and pretrained large language models in models. They can be faster, use a wider knowledge base and be a more standard evaluation approach especially for fact-based theoretical examinations.\n",

    "Smartphone usage penetration in the country is quite decent, these phones are equipped with decent cameras and internet browsers - conduits to utilization of deployed machine learning solutions. The smartphones can be used to take photos of the examinations and answers then uploaded through the deployed solutions, from which assements and results would be relayed back to the assessors.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most critical step for machine learning involvement is the extractiong of questions from the photos of examination question papers, with just that, it would actually be possible to generate marking schemes. The ideas is to then couple this with answer this with question extract and the results of this pair is what would then be passed to pretrained models such as GPT 4 for evaluation.\n",
